  <h3> Overview of 60 Coursera MOOCs </h3>
  <p>
   The bubble chart is dominated by blue bubbles, indicating that the majority of this 60-MOOC sample consists of quantitative courses. Nevertheless, the class with the largest number of users is not quantitative. It is Introduction to Psychology, which falls under science. In fact, the second most popular class (Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence) is a business class rather than a quantitative one. Finally, Startup Engineering, a quantitative class, takes the third place in the popularity contest.

  <h3> Culture of MOOCs </h3>
  <p>
    Each class seems to have a different culture shown by the kinds of topics that students discuss in the forum. Still, there is a similar trend in some of the classes I have seen so far. The earlier weeks/modules such as Week 1 and Module 1 usually have more threads than the later ones like Week 7 and Module 6. One justification for this observation is that interest in the material may decline as users progress through the courses, so they may be less active in discussion forums.

<h2>MOOCs still have Potential to be the Next Big Thing in Education</h2>

 <h3> MOOCs as a Platform for EdTech Experiments </h3>
   <p>
   Intro to Psych has a forum thread on Digital Labcoat, which is an online learning tool that can launch students' surveys on a range of topics. The class also uses Peer Scholar, a peer-assessment technology that allows students to share assignments and receive anonymous peer feedback. This tool also personalizes feedback and encourages students to reflect on the personalized feedback. <br/><br/>
Given this example, we can conclude that MOOCs can serve as a platform to test and promote other educational technologies. With MOOCs, it is convenient to experiment with new Internet-based technologies in the classroom since they are more compatible with online classes than conventional classrooms. For example, Peer Scholar makes sense in the online world where people cannot physically meet each other to do peer review. However, the traditional classroom may not be a welcoming place for the new technology, because they already have something that works: real-time peer feedback. Students can do peer review during class hours or as homework. Peer Scholar seems like an excessive step when students can do in-person peer review or simply exchange their assigments through various means of communication such as email for peer commentary<br/><br/>
Also, integrating these Internet-based technologies in the classroom would often meet resistance from social constructivists. Social constructivism is the theory that claims that groups construct knowledge from one another and create a culture of collective artifacts with shared meanings. From the social constructivism perspective, in-person feedback instead of Peer Scholar would greatly support learning, because it allows social connection and social learning through body language, which is something that these edtechs lack. Social constructivists would see the lack of body language as a limitation of Internet-based educational technologies, so they could use this argument against experimenting these Internet-based technologies in the classroom. However, that argument is not valid in the online world where you simply don't get the luxury of in-person interactions. As a result, experimentation with these technologies is more welcomed in online classes. 

Furthermore, MOOCs make it easy to test new technologies on a large and diverse pool of users since they have access to a large audience from all the over world. As an example of learning at scale, MOOCs attracts a large audience from various backgrounds with its association with world-renowned universities. Even though MOOCs has a high dropout rate and does not provide education equity, it is good at reaching out to people on the global scale.

  <h3> MOOCs Support Hybrid Learning </h3>
  <p>
  MOOCs supports hybrid learning. In the startup engineering class, about 6% of its 6414 discussion threads are dedicated to meetups and hackathons. These threads are a result of students taking the initiative or the class requiring in-person meetups. Either way, people can get together in real life for group activities through MOOCs. As a result, this class demonstrates that MOOCs has the capabilities to offer a mix of online learning and in-person learning: a hybrid education. Though this case is not common in MOOCs, it shows that people are willing to meet in person if there is a concrete and specific goal that can be achieved by getting together. In the case of this startup engineering course, the students are interested in doing hackathons as teams, networking, and possibly founding startups together. These activities are specific, relevant, and feasible, making them appealing. Plus, they also offer immediate rewards. <br/><br/>
  MOOCs can incorporate classes, assignments, and activities that encourage in-person interactions through these incentives.
